						<a id="Associate" class="anchor">Associate</a>
						<h4>Associate<span style="font-weight:normal">(Jan. 2015 - Present)</span></h4>
							<p>I was promoted from Analyst to Associate a year before my peers, in January 2012. As an Associate, I acted as secondary relationship coverage for U.S. Large Corporate clients, supporting their treasury and cash management needs. During this time, I helped cover Fortune 500 companies within the "Diversified Industrials" sector, which included industrial, automotive, transportation, and defense companies. My primary responsibilities during this time included secondary sales generation, proposal and pricing model preparation, customer research, client onboarding and due diligence, and implementation support. After spending a year as an Associate, I was promoted to Senior Associate.</p>
						<a id="Analyst" class="anchor">Analyst</a>
						<h4>Analyst<span style="font-weight:normal">(Jan. 2015 - Present)</span></h4>
							<p>After spending the summer of 2011 as an intern on the FX & Interest Rates Derivatives desk, I was offered the opportunity to join J.P. Morgan full-time in June 2012. I spent my first year as an Analyst on the FX & Interest Rates Derivatives desk, covering U.S. Large Corporates. My primary responsibilities included executing spot, forward, and options transactions, providing market insight and commentary, and structuring derivatives products tailored to clients' needs. After completing my first year, I moved to Treasury Sales, where I spent the rest of my tenure as an Analyst before being promoted.

						<h4><a id="Regional Manager">Regional Manager <span style="font-weight:normal">(May 2010 - Sep. 2010)</span></a></h4></a></h4>
							<p>After my first summer with Ivy Insiders, I was promoted to Regional Manager and given direct oversight of the Southwest 2 Region of Ivy Insiders, which consisted of 29 Ivy Insiders branches in California and Hawaii. As Regional Manager, I directed marketing and sales strategy for my region and led nearly 30 branch managers in establishing and growing Ivy Insiders branches in their hometowns. I also controlled a 6-figure P&L, held daily conference calls with branch managers, forecasted sales, and formulated weekly and monthly plans for my branch managers to follow. By the end of my first summer as a Regional Manager, I had led the region to nearly $200,000 in revenue, #2 out of 20 regions nationwide.</p>
						<h4><a id="Branch Manager">Branch Manager <span style="font-weight:normal">(May 2009 - Sep. 2010)</span></a></h4>
							<p>In May 2009, I was hired to establish a branch location for Harvard-based test prep company Ivy Insiders in my hometown of Denver, Colorado. As the Branch Founder and Manager, I performed all sales, marketing, and operations tasks for my Ivy Insiders branch, including meeting and creating partnerships with the leaders of local businesses and schools, making hundreds of cold calls, submitting press releases to local and state newspapers, and hiring campus leaders to perform marketing tasks at schools around Colorado. By the end of my first summer as Branch Founder, I achieved National Gold Branch Manager status by generating over $70,000 of revenue, 6th out of 207 branches nationwide.</p>
